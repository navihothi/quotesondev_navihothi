I don't think I found this to be as difficult as project four, but I still found it somewhat difficult but easier to grasp onto some of the topics.
 I used my classmates, wordpress and stack overflow to help me solve a lot of the problems that I had with the project.

 What I found the most difficult was:
 - still understanding php and how everything links
 

 What I didn't find so difficult was:
 - styling css came very easily to me
 - part of the html and writing out the structure
